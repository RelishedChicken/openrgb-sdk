## My attempt at reworking this SDK

This is a fork of [openrgb-sdk](https://github.com/Mola19/openrgb-sdk) that has recently become incompatible with protocol 5 in [OpenRGB](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/ "gitlab/CalcProgramer1/OpenRGB"). I'm attempting to get it to work as it's a core dependency to my 5 year old smart home lighting setup for my office.

It's entirely possible I won't be able to get that far - I'm not a TS or JS expert..reach out if you know what needs doing!

# About

An SDK client for the RGB Software [OpenRGB](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/ "gitlab/CalcProgramer1/OpenRGB")

# Installation

Currently not ready for this at all - needs more work and for local use only - see how to import local packages first and then clone and use from there.
## Setup

### OpenRGB

Installation: [Gitlab OpenRGB Setup and Usage](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/wikis/OpenRGB-Windows-Setup-and-Usage)

### Usage

This is identical to the project it's forked from and it's predecessor minus a few differences. Take a look at the extensive docs there as I will only add proper documentation once I've got this to a point that works well
